## The Vision Behind Senselet

Senselet was born from a simple observation: retail logistics is often fragmented and reactive. I set out to build a platform that doesn't just track inventory, but predicts its movement.

### Engineering the Digital Twin

The core of Senselet is its "Digital Twin" capability. This isn't just a 3D model—it's a real-time data representation of physical inventory across global warehouses. Synchronizing this data with sub-second latency required a robust architecture using Next.js and high-frequency API endpoints.

### Cognitive Sales Forecasting

By implementing weighted moving average algorithms and analyzing historical trends, Senselet provides "Cognitive Forecasting." This helps retailers anticipate stockouts before they happen, effectively democratizing enterprise-grade logistics for smaller businesses.

### The Solo Developer Challenge

Building Senselet as a solo project meant wearing every hat—Architect, Frontend Engineer, and DevOps. From designing the Tailwind-powered glassmorphism UI to integrating the Telegram API for instant stock alerts, every decision was aimed at creating a seamless, automated infrastructure.
