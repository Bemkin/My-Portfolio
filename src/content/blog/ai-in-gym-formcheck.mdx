## The Problem: Improper Form

In fitness, form is everything. Improper technique leads to injury and stalled progress. FormCheck AI was built to act as a virtual coach that never blinks.

### Integrating Mediapipe

By leveraging the Mediapipe framework, I implemented real-time body tracking directly in the browser. The application analyzes joint angles and movement planes to provide immediate feedback on squat depth, back posture, and more.

### Real-Time vs. Asynchronous Feedback

The app supports two modes: live camera analysis for instant correction, and video upload for detailed post-workout review. This flexibility ensures that whether you're at the gym or home, your technique remains flawless.

### Future of AI-Driven Fitness

FormCheck AI isn't just a gimmick; it's a look at the future of personalized training. By blending computer vision with a reactive Next.js frontend, I've created a tool that makes high-level coaching accessible to everyone with a smartphone.
